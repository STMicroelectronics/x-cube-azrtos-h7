## <b>Ux_Device_CustomHID application description</b>

This application provides an example of Azure RTOS USBX stack usage on STM32H743I-EVAL board,
it shows how to develop USB Device Human Interface "HID" custom based application.

The application is designed to emulate an USB HID custom device, the code provides all required device descriptors framework
and associated class descriptor report to build a compliant USB HID custom device.

At the beginning ThreadX calls the entry function tx_application_define(), at this stage, all USBx resources
are initialized, the HID class driver is registered and the application creates 2 threads with the same priorities :

  - app_ux_device_thread_entry (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to initialize USB_OTG HAL PCD driver and start the device.
  - usbx_cutomhid_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to send HID reports to move automatically the PC host machine.

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

When plugged to PC host, the STM32H743I-EVAL must be properly enumerated as an USB HID custom device.
During the enumeration phase, device provides host with the requested descriptors (device, configuration, string).
Those descriptors are used by host driver to identify the device capabilities.

Once the STM32H743I-EVAL USB device successfully completed the enumeration phase:
 - Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet, available for download from www.st.com,
   and connect STM32 USB to PC
 - The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box
 - Press Graphic View button
 - Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID report
   for LED control
 - Use the potentiometer of the STM32H743I-EVAL board to transfer the result of the converted voltage
  (via the ADC) to the PC host (these values are sent to the PC using the endpoint1 IN)
 - Make sure that the following report IDs are configured: LED1 ID (0x1), LED2 ID(0x2), LED3 ID(0x3),
   LED4 ID(0x4), BUTTON1_ID(0x6) and Potentiometer_ID(0x7).
 - Select LEDs to switch on/off on the STM32H743I-EVAL board: a SET_REPORT request will be sent.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

Host PC shows that USB device does not operate as designed (HID device enumeration failed).

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>

User is familiar with USB 2.0 "Universal Serial BUS" specification and HID class specification.

#### <b>Known limitations</b>

None.

### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (64 KB up to 256kB) which decreases critical task execution time, compared to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in the ITCM-RAM.
 2.  If the application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs. If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
      - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000).
      - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
      - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters) must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).
 3.  It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence:
      - Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      - Please refer to the **AN4838** "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs".
      - Please refer to the **AN4839** "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

#### <b>ThreadX usage hints</b>

 - ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.
 - ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it, by updating the "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND" define in the "tx_user.h" file. The update should be reflected in "tx_initialize_low_level.S" file too.
 - ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.
 - ThreadX offers the "tx_application_define()" function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API.
   It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools...)  but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).
 - Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file.
   ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function,
   using the "first_unused_memory" argument.
   This requires changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
    + For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:
     ```
     place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };
     ```
    + For MDK-ARM:
     ```
    either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the ".sct" file
    or modify the line below in "tx_initialize_low_level.S to match the memory region being used
        LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|
    ```
    + For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:
    ```
    ._threadx_heap :
      {
         . = ALIGN(8);
         __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
         . = . + 64K;
         . = ALIGN(8);
       } >RAM_D1 AT> RAM_D1
    ```

       The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
       In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
       The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.
       Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).
       Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: "Linker script".

    + The "tx_initialize_low_level.S" should be also modified to enable the "USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION" flag.

#### <b>USBX usage hints</b>

- The DTCM (0x20000000) memory region should not be used by application in case USB DMA is enabled
- Should make sure to configure the USB pool memory region with attribute "Non-Cacheable" to ensure coherency between CPU and USB DMA
